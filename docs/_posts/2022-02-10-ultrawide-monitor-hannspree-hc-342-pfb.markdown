## Searching a monitor
I thought for a while what monitor type to choose. I made research online what kind would serve me, a mobile software engineer, best. I want to get maximum productivity from my monitor, my monitor must be there for me for multitasking, must have a decent quality and not be super expensive.


In the meantime, I ordered a 28" 4K Acer from Amazon during Christmas period. I had the opportunity to try out a 4K monitor. I never had used 4K before.
I enjoyed it. I liked how the text is indeed crisp. It has 16:9 ratio size. For multimedia content it proved an excellent choice. 

I had to return it to Amazon. It didnot fulfill my original needs: a monitor best suited for multitasking. Maybe it was me not suited for this monitor, not the other way around. 

I had to use it in 1080p, otherwise text is really, really small. (Please note I wear glasses and I have shortsight of -1.75). So if I use it in 1080p, I am losing out from screen space.
That is when I decided that I needed something different.

Looking for other options, I decided maybe I have to make a big jump and go straight to 40-something-inch screens, but they cost a lost. Even a 38" monitor costs a lot.
Then making a research online I discovered this 34" ultrawide, 3440x1440 monitor from Hannspree. I looked for reviews on it, couldnot find any. I looked for video materials on it, Youtube didnot have any.

I made my choice that I want to own this monitor from looking at its photos provided from this vendor's site and from official www.hannspree.com.

## Hannspree HC-342-PFB
I received <a href="https://www.hannspree.eu/product/hc-342-pfb/" target="_blank">this monitor </a> just today. I opened it, I turned it on. It is just brilliant. 
It has the one of the most ergonomic stands out there. The monitor goes up, goes down. It tilts. It has a stereo speaker, offers 3840x2160 (which I have to try out yet) even though it is advertised as 3440x1440 monitor.

I will be testing it out more in the coming days and updating my review. 
Remain tuned.
